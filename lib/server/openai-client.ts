/**
 * An OpenAI client that finds its key when it makes a call, not when its module loads. Signed in
 * with Orgo, calls go through Bops Cloud (lib/server/cloud.ts) on the user's Orgo key. The base URL
 * is read per call too, so a sign-in or sign-out applies at once, and the live call sideband
 * (phone.ts), which builds its WebSocket address from the client's, goes through the cloud as well.
 * Self-hosting, it's OPENAI_API_KEY: the Mac app ships with no keys, and a client made with
 * `new OpenAI()` throws on import without one, which takes down every route that imports it.
